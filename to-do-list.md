1. Maybe divide the project into different modules:
    1.0. divide boilerplates.py when it gets too complex later on
         (or maybe store other interesting insights, such as git
         and Python specific stuff?)
    1.1. algorithms
    1.2. data_structures
    1.3. problems
    1.4. test_cases
